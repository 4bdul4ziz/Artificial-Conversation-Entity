            Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
            So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
            You never been on a ride like this before
            With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
            At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
            You know and I know, I flow some ol' funky shit
            To add to my collection, the selection
            Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
            If you do, you'll have no clue
            Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do
            It's like this and like that and like this and uh
            It's like that and like this and like that and uh
            It's like this
            And who gives a fuck about those?
            So just chill 'til the next episode"
